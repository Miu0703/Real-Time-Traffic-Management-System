Aim:
Developed a high-throughput traffic management system, optimizing route planning using Dijkstra’s algorithm, achieving a 40% improvement in pathfinding efficiency.
Integrated Kafka for real-time data streaming and AWS Lambda for scalable cloud deployment, handling 100,000+ concurrent users with sub-second response times.
Designed an interactive dashboard using Plotly for real-time traffic visualization and data insights for city officials.


Project Overview:
1. Route Planning Optimization (C++)
Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for pathfinding.
Optimize the algorithm for efficiency.

2. Real-Time Data Streaming (Kafka)
Set up Kafka for handling real-time traffic data streams.

3.Scalable Cloud Deployment (AWS Lambda)
Deploy serverless functions using AWS Lambda to handle concurrent users.

4. Interactive Dashboard (Plotly)
Create a real-time dashboard for traffic visualization and data insights.
